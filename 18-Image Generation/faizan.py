# The detailed prompt we generated for the image
prompt = """
Create an image of a young adult (around 28 years old, 170cm tall, weighing around 65kg) who is female with a Sub-Saharan African ethnicity. She has a slender physique with a muscular build and a confident expression. Her skin is smooth and deep brown, and her hair is styled in a natural curly Afro.

Facial Features: Her face is oval-shaped with a slight angular jawline, full lips with a natural pink hue, and almond-shaped dark brown eyes. She has slightly arched eyebrows and a soft, warm smile.
Outfit: She is wearing casual jeans and a t-shirt, and her style is comfortable yet chic.
Scene: She is standing casually in a park with trees and grass in the background, illuminated by soft, natural sunlight from the golden hour.
Lighting & Mood: The lighting should capture the soft glow of the late afternoon sun, with natural, realistic detailsâ€”no professional photography, just a candid moment like a smartphone photo. Her expression is relaxed and approachable.
