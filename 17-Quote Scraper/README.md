# 📚 Quote Scraper

This project consists of Python scripts designed to scrape author information and their associated quotes from the website [quote.org](https://quote.org). The process is divided into two main parts to implement threading for enhanced performance and efficiency.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

The project is split into two primary scripts, each handling different parts of the scraping process:

### 1. **`ThreadQoutePart1.py`** – Retrieve Author Information and Quote Links

- **Purpose:** This script is responsible for scraping information about authors, including their names, professions, nationalities, and links to their quotes.
- **Process:**
  - Sends a POST request to the **authors page** to retrieve a list of authors.
  - Scrapes author details like **Name**, **Profession**, **Nationality**, and the **Link** to their quotes.
  - **Threading** is applied to handle multiple author retrieval requests concurrently.

### 2. **`ThreadQoutePart2.py`** – Retrieve Quotes Information

- **Purpose:** This script scrapes the **quotes** of each author retrieved in the previous step.
- **Process:**
  - Retrieves quote details such as **Quote Text**, **Context**, **Citations**, **Related Quotes**, and **Concept Boxes**.
  - Uses threading to fetch quotes data for multiple authors simultaneously.
  
### 3. **`objects_to_excel.py`** – Save Data to Excel

- **Purpose:** This script converts the scraped data into an Excel file for easy storage and analysis.
- **Process:**
  - Converts the collected quote and author data into a structured format.
  - Saves the data as a well-organized Excel file (`Qoudata.xlsx`).

## 🧑‍💻 Step-by-Step Overview

### **Step 1: Retrieve Author Information**
- Scrapes the list of authors along with their information and stores the data.
- Each author’s profile is retrieved, and their **Quote Link** is saved for further extraction.

### **Step 2: Retrieve Quotes**
- For each author, the quotes are retrieved from their individual pages.
- This includes retrieving text for each quote, its **Context**, **Citation**, and other related metadata.

### **Threading for Efficiency**
- **Threading** is applied in both steps to fetch data concurrently, significantly reducing execution time.
- The first part scrapes author details concurrently, while the second part retrieves their quotes concurrently.

### **Saving Data**
- All scraped data is stored in a structured format and exported into an Excel file, making it easy to work with and analyze.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   To set up the project, you need the following Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
   ```

2. **Running the Script:**
   - First, run `ThreadQoutePart1.py` to retrieve author information and their quote links.
   - Then, run `ThreadQoutePart2.py` to scrape the quotes for the authors.

3. **Output:**
   - The final data will be saved into an Excel file: `Qoudata.xlsx`.

## 📁 Files Overview

- **`ThreadQoutePart1.py`** – Scrapes author details and quote links.
- **`ThreadQoutePart2.py`** – Scrapes quotes for the authors.
- **`objects_to_excel.py`** – Converts the scraped data into an Excel file.

## 📌 Notes

- **Threading** significantly enhances performance for large-scale scraping, especially when fetching quotes for numerous authors.
- **Rate Limiting** may apply depending on the website's structure. Consider implementing additional mechanisms like rotating proxies or handling delays if necessary.

This project demonstrates the power of **threading** for efficient web scraping, allowing for the extraction of large amounts of data with minimal delay. With threading applied to both author data and quotes data retrieval, this project is well-suited for large-scale scraping tasks.
