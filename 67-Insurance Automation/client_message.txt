few remarks please:

Mamda: Brise de glace & Dommage et collision / franchise tierce upper part of the conditions is not scrapped 
Rma : explanation of points in the small "i" next to each condition is not scrapped, it should be displayed same as them please  + tous risque OTO is not displayed 
Axa case is still not retrieving all data and I see a misalignment in the names of each option in Axa, I think it still requires work. 

Also, I will buy the captcha to add sanlam insurer too. can you tell me which captcha to buy as there are many in the website you sent me

but the overall structure is fine for me, just should fix this and then it should be fine. 

in litesql table it should be organized as follows, 4 tables, each for each insurers, here are the columns : 

all the columns of based on the form filled by the user or broker or whatever + price / condition per option for example for rma it should be : Name, Driver license.... the 10+ fields + Basique OTO price + Basique OTO condition + Optimal OTO price + Optimal OTO condition + Confort OTO Price + Confort OTO condition + TOus risque OTO Price + Tous risque OTO conditions.
